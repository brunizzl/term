# term
the goal here is to simplify mathematical terms. e.g. convert "2*a+b+a" to "3*a+b" as an example.

for your own sake: don't use it. i only have this monstrosity on github to synchonise between my computers. and it is only public to show to  friends.
but if you wanna use it anyway: go for it. no guarantees for anything though.
